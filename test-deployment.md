## Troubleshooting Steps:

### If changes aren't visible:

1. **Check Backend is Running New Code:**
   - Check backend logs for migration messages
   - Verify API endpoints return new fields

2. **Check Frontend Build:**
   - Clear browser cache completely
   - Check Network tab for 304 vs 200 responses
   - Verify source code in DevTools

3. **Check Database:**
   - Verify `mistake_corrected` column exists in trades table
   - Check if production database schema matches local

### Database Check Commands (if needed):
```sql
-- Check if mistake_corrected column exists
PRAGMA table_info(trades);
-- or for PostgreSQL:
\d trades;
```

### Manual Migration (if needed):
```sql
ALTER TABLE trades ADD COLUMN mistake_corrected BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0;
```
