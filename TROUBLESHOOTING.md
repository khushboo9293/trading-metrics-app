# ðŸ”§ Trading Metrics App - Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem: "Site Cannot Be Reached" on localhost

### Possible Causes:
1. macOS security/firewall blocking localhost connections
2. Network interface configuration issues
3. VPN or proxy interference
4. DNS resolution problems

## Solutions to Try:

### 1. Check macOS Security Settings
```bash
# Open Security & Privacy settings
open "x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.security?firewall"

# Ensure "Block all incoming connections" is OFF
# Ensure Firewall is either OFF or configured to allow Node.js/Terminal
```

### 2. Try Different Localhost Addresses
- `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`
- `http://0.0.0.0:8080/`
- `http://localhost:8080/`

### 3. Check Network Interface
```bash
# Check network interfaces
ifconfig

# Test basic connectivity
ping 127.0.0.1
```

### 4. Clear DNS Cache
```bash
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache
```

### 5. Disable VPN/Proxy Temporarily
If you're using a VPN or proxy, try disabling it temporarily.

### 6. Use Production Build (Recommended)
The React app has been built successfully. You can serve it with any static file server:

```bash
# Navigate to the project
cd /Users/khushboo/trading-metrics-app/frontend

# Serve the built files
python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory dist

# Or use Node.js serve package
npx serve -s dist -l 8080
```

### 7. Alternative: Use Different Port
Some ports that commonly work:
- 3000, 8000, 9000, 8080, 4000

### 8. Check for Port Conflicts
```bash
# See what's using ports
lsof -i :8080
netstat -an | grep 8080
```

## Current App Status:
âœ… Backend API: Built and ready (port 3001)
âœ… Frontend: Built and responsive
âœ… React components: Working
âœ… Responsive design: Implemented

## Recommended Next Step:
Try using the built production version with a simple file server, as the development server seems to have networking issues on your system.
